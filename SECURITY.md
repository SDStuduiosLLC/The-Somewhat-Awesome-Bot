# SDStudios Standard OSS Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the way that TSAB is released and rolled out (continous upgrades and deployments), there is *currently* no set "supported versions". We do plan on starting to do offical versioned releases, which will have a gradual EOL date.

For now, as long as you use the latest code from the main branch, you should be fine.
