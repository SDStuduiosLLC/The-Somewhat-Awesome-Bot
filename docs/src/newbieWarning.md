# Newbie Warning
?> If you don't know your way around DiscordJS, TypeScript, the command line and other developer type things. This isn't for you. While I try and keep it maintainable, you need to know what you're doing.

If this is your first time playing around with code wanting a Discord bot. Stop. Try a tutorial, this isn't for you. You will get stuck, and I don't really have the time to help sadly. I want to see people succeed in learning new things, but this isn't the place.

If you do choose to endeavour, and you don't understand all of it. I truly hope you succeed, but I probably won't be here to help you. Read the docs, use Google. Apart from that I don't have much to say.
