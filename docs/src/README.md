# The Somewhat Awesome Bot

Hey there! Welcome to the 100% very well written and up-to-date documentation for my open source bot TAB (The Somewhat Awesome Bot - I shortened it because I can't be bothered typing it every time).

Here you should find;

- Setup Information
- Config.ts Template
- Command Templates
- Info About the Permissions System
- & So Much More! (Maybe, No Promises)

## Getting Started

Before anything, check out the [newbies warning](/newbieWarning) if you are new to coding, servers and that typa stuff.

Now, go check out the sidebar for all the info you would need!

Check out the [getting started](/gettingStarted/installation) section if you've only come here to set up the bot.

?> Please note that documentation may be behind or ahead of the active codebase. 

I will try to remember to add a notice if a section is ahead of the live and accessible code.

But don't rely on me doing so.
