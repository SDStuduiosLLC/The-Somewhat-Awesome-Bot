# The MBB Community Bot

This is the home for the Discord bot that looks after the MBB Gaming Discord!

## Installation

It's just a simple clone of the repo and a bit of setup!

Please note before starting! If you don't have experience with DiscordJS, TypeScript, the command line, hosting and general developer stuff, this isn't for you. It can take quite a bit of setup to get it working, and I'm **NOT** here to fix any of your issues.

**Step 1** - Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/summerisadev/MBB-Community-Bot.git
```


**Step 2** - Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```


**Step 3** - Change the settings

cp env.example .env
```

You know, USE THE TEMPLATE


**Step 4** - Build & Compile

tsc && yarn run start-prod
```
