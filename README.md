This is the home for the Discord bot that, I mean does stuff..

## Installation

It's just a simple clone of the repo and a bit of setup!

Please note before starting! If you don't have experience with DiscordJS, TypeScript, the command line, hosting and general developer stuff, this isn't for you. It can take quite a bit of setup to get it working, and I'm **NOT** here to fix any of your issues.

Goto ```data/config.ts``` and fill in all the fields

### Quick Note!
This project was made with JetBrains and GitHub software in mind, and in use. So while you don't need to use either, I would **highly** recommend using them for the best experience. 

And yes, I know JetBrains isn't free, but if you are a student, sign up for the student package! 100% worth it.
