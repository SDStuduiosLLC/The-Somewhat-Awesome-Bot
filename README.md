## The Discord bot framework that gets s**t done. 
Here is the home of the bot framework known as TSAB (The Somewhat Awesome Bot). It's a lightweight and heavily customisable Discord bot with a quick turnaround time, whilst the user has very quick access to all the connections to Discord being made.

## Installation & Usage

Ok, to be honest with you, you'll need to read the docs for that. There's quite a lot of work that goes into setting up and configuring TSAB. That's not even getting into creating commands!
